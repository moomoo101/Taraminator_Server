    CONSOLE APPLICATION : VolumeCalculation Project Overview
========================================================================
Volume Calculation:

1. In the start of the application the depth of the base from the camera is calculated.
2. The breadth and the length is calculated using edge detection and contour. 
3. The application does not evaluate the scene for a box. So the scene must have only the box i.e no other edges.
